The solution involves avoiding percentages inside the `calc()` function when dealing with other units. A safer approach is to pre-calculate the values using Sass or another preprocessor, or to use a different CSS approach altogether for the layout.  For example, instead of relying on `calc()` for complex percentage-based widths, consider using flexbox or grid for a more robust and predictable layout.   If pre-calculating isn't an option, refactor to avoid `calc`.
