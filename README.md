This repository demonstrates a subtle but important issue with the CSS `calc()` function.  The problem arises when using percentages within `calc()` in conjunction with other units. The behavior is inconsistent across browsers and can lead to unexpected layout inconsistencies. The `bug.css` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a corrected approach.

**Problem:** Inconsistent layout due to the order of operations and how browsers interpret percentages within the `calc()` function when used with other units.

**Solution:** Avoid using percentages with other units (like `rem` or `em`) directly inside `calc()`.  Instead, pre-calculate the values or use a different approach entirely.
